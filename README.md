<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CharlyJoncheray/windbnb/master/.github/images/windbnb.png)

I create a small version of Airbnb - Windbnb with given data by using React.
I fullfiled the differents stories bellow :

- I can see a list of properties
- I can see the property card with a name, rating, apartment type, and super host
- I can open the filter drawer
- I can filter properties by location and number of guests
- I can see the number of filtered items
- I can see pages following given designs

I decided to use sass and mobile first approach. I also use absolute import for to simplify imports in the project. For that, I used craco to override the webpack configuration provided by create-react-app.
